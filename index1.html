        <h1>Welcome To Our Corp.</h1>

      <h3>To Employee #18-05-04-19-08-09-18-20,</h3>
      <h4>Welcome to Lobotomy Corporation. I am Angela, the manager’s advisor and secretary. Even though I am AI, feel free to send any concerns you may have to me. </h4>
      <h4>You have joined the company at an opportune moment. The energy consumption rate is ever increasing as technology advances. Conventional energy sources could not sustain the world anymore. In search of solutions, we stumbled upon mysterious beings we dubbed Abnormalities. They were among us from the beginning, but we only recently “noticed” their presence. We discovered that we could harvest energy from these beings using a special method. Thus, we isolate them in a controlled environment and harvest this energy––Enkephalin––from them. The company became one of the Wings of the World for this discovery. It is very important that you know and understand these things to be successful as an employee. </h4>
      <h4>Right now, Lobotomy Corporation is looking for ways to improve its energy harvest processes. Our systems are continually updated to support this. That means working conditions have been improved from last year. But of course, as an employee, you have no need to know the details of such things. Included in this email are links to a few websites. They contain surface-level information on your comrades, your superiors, and what you will be working with. It is important that you familiarize yourself with this information, as the work here is hazardous and we take no responsibility for isolated accidents.</h4>
      <h4>I am looking forward to working alongside you.</h4>
      <h4>All the best,</h4>
      <h3>~Angela</h3>
