      <h1>About You</h1>
      <h5></h5>
      <h4>- You are starting work in Lobotomy Corporation as a clerk.</h4>
      <h4>- Your job is to give assistance to fellow workers, as well as to do anything they are doing.</h4>
      <h4>- Your employee ID card must be finished and printed before arriving at work, otherwise you will be suppressed  at the front gate. We are not responsible for you in this case.</h4>
      <h4><i>NOTE: The available ID Card Creators can be found <a href="https://picrew.me/image_maker/72003">here</a>, <a href="https://picrew.me/image_maker/402996">here</a>, and <a href="https://picrew.me/image_maker/10445">here</a>.</i></h4>

      <h1>Enkephalin</h1>
      <h5></h5>
      <h4>- Upon successful work with an Abnormality, PE Boxes (Positive Enkephalin) are produced. These are vital.</h4>
      <h4>- You will be given a quota of Enkephalin to produce every day.</h4>
      <h4>- We MUST reach this quota, or your workday will not end. For all employees, the day's work only ends when the quota is reached.</h4>
      <h4><i>NOTE: We WILL keep you here until the daily quota is met. Your lawyers cannot stop us.</i></h4>

      <h5></h5>
      <h1>E.G.O. Equipment</h1>
      <h5></h5>
      <h4>- The PE Boxes we gain from Abnormalities can be formed into useful tools for employees to use. These are called EGOs.</h4>
      <h4>- You will inevitably be given an E.G.O. while working here. Use them for self-defense and suppression.</h4>
      <h4>- Your E.G.O. weapons can be upgraded using T-09-97 "Old Belief and Promise" (though you may end up breaking it, in which case, we do not offer replacements).</h4>
      <h4><i>NOTE: You are not permitted to take your E.G.O. home with you.</i></h4>
